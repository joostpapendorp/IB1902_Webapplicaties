# IB1902 Webapplicaties: de clientkant
This is the implementation of the second assignment for the Open University course.

### Workflow
We use a [trello boad](https://trello.com/b/djHvyLDG/ib1902-webapplicaties-opdracht-2) for story/issue tracking. We record our architectural decisions [here](./docs/adr/readme.md) in [ADR format](https://adr.github.io/) using [phodals adr tools](https://github.com/phodal/adr). We maintain a [logbook](./docs/logbook.md) during development. This (and other) documentation is in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format. If your IDE/editor doesn't support a viewer, one can be found [here](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter/releases/tag/2.1.6). We adhere to our [Definition of Done](./docs/Definition-of-Done.md) before merging.

### Licensing

# 1. We will use Trello as issue tracker system.

Date: 2023-01-24

## Decision

We use Atlassian Trello as an issue tracker system. The board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/djHvyLDG/ib1902-webapplicaties-opdracht-2)


#### Rinaldo is no longer a teammate
Even though the 'team' now only consists of Joost, we keep this structure for educational and demonstrational purposes.


## Context

This project serves as a study assignment. It needs to demonstrate the capabilities of its creators. A issue board provides insight in the planning of the project. Both participants are familiar with Trello.


## Demands

* simplicity and ease of use
* ease of accessibility 


## Consequences and alternatives

None considered.

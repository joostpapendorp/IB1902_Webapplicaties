# 3. We will keep a development log book

Date: 2023-02-17


## Decision

We keep a log book detailing development activity and communication.


#### Rinaldo is no longer a teammate
Even though the 'team' now only consists of Joost, we keep this structure for educational and demonstrational purposes.


## Context

We want to provide insight into the development process. We want to keep track of communication and be able to look up past communications easily and fast.


## Consequences and alternatives

A log book is an addition onto Trello and ADR in that it provides us a means to communicate activity and external communications effectively and timely within the team. We use it as an alternative to more formal meetings, speeding up cooperation. It also serves as an archive to look up practical information, such as e-mail addresses etc.

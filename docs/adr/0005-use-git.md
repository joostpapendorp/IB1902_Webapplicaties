# 5. We will use GIT for version control 

Date: 2023-02-17


## Decision

* We will use GIT as a versioning control system. 
* We will use GitHub as online store. 
* We adhere to the simple branching model using pull requests. 
* We do not tool our git processes.

## Context

Collaborating over a distance requires a shared system. Team is familiar using GIT. The project is small. Tooling must be free (gratis, libre)


## Consequences and alternatives

GIT is the de facto standard. GitHub and BitBucket are the two main free providers. BitBucket is sponsored by Atlassian, and we use their Trello as well, but integration between these is not required. GitHub has a better track record than BitBucket on open source projects like this one.
